# The rhombic triacontahedron

The goal of this project is to craft, with thick paper a [rhombic
triacontahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombic_triacontahedron),
hereafter shorten to RT. And because we are doing oceanography, we
want this RT to represent a meaningful quantity, for instance the
ocean bathymetry.

## Who?
With the M1 Students of the Marine Physics master's program!

## What will we learn?
We'll learn about spherical geometry and projections. We'll improve
our programming skills because we'll do that in Python.We will also
improve the group work techniques because this is a collaborative
project.

## Spherical rotations
For spherical rotations, we have two options: i) the matrix route or
the ii) the quaternions one. Guess which one we'll use ?

Don't know what the quaternions are ? They are like the complex
numbers but with two additionnal imaginary numbers: so instead of 1
and i, there is 1, i, j and k. To get the connection with 3D rotations

amazing Grant Sanderson, aka 3blue1brown.
