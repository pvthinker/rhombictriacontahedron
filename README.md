# The rhombic triacontahedron

The goal of this project is to craft, with thick paper a [rhombic
triacontahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombic_triacontahedron),
hereafter shorten to RTCH. And because we are doing oceanography, we
want this RTCH to represent a meaningful quantity, for instance the
ocean bathymetry.

## Who?
With the M1 Students of the Marine Physics master's program!

## What will we learn?
We'll learn about spherical geometry and projections. We'll improve
our programming skills because we'll do that in Python.We will also
improve the group work techniques because this is a collaborative
project.
