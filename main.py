    Here are the following tasks I see
    (inspired from how people do with the spherical cube)

    1) project a field on a rhombus drawn at the surface of the sphere
    2) rotate a rhombus centered at the North pole to any location
    3) determine the coordinates and the orientation of the 30 faces
    4) assemble the rhombuses in blocks to form the set.

    Task 4 is optionnal. We can either print the 30 faces detached from
    each other, or having them grouped by blocks to spare some pasting
    during the crafting
